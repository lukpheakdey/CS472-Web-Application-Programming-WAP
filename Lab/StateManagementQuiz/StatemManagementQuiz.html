            State Management Quiz
        </h1>

        <p class="question">Question 1: Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</p>
        NO, Post request cannot be bookmarked because the data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the
        HTTP request.

        <p class="question">Question 2: What is the purpose of request dispatching?</p>
        The purpose of request dispatching is to internally pass the request processing to another local resource or to tell
        client browser to issue another HTTP request to a specific URL.

        <p class="question">Question 3: What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</p>
        Forward:       
            <ul>
                <li> Pass the request to another resource on the server. Sometimes referred as "server side redirect".</li>
                <li> The request and response object passed to the destination servlet.</li>
                <li> Browser is completely unaware of servlet forward, and hence the the URL will remain unchanged.</li>
            </ul>
        Redirect:
            <ul>
                <li> Servlet sends HTTP code 3xx to client along with the redirect URL (usually 302 temporary redirect).</li>
                <li> Client then sends a new request to the URL.</li>
                <li> extra round trip.</li>
                <li> only HTTP message sent, the request and response object cannot be sent.</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p class="question">Question 4: What is an attribute ?</p>
        An attribute is an object that is used to share information in a web app. Attribute allows servlet to share information
        among themselves. <br>
        An attribute is an object bound into one of three servlet API objects:
        <ul>
            <li>HTTPServletRequest.</li>
            <li>HTTPSession.</li>
            <li>ServletContext.</li>
        </ul>
     
        <p class="question">Question 5: What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Parameter is a name/value pair sent from client to the server - typically, from a HTML form. Parameters can only store
                    String values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An attribute is a server-local storage mechanism. Attributes have String name, but store Object values. Note that
                    attributes are specific to Java, while parameter are platform-independent.
                </li>
            </ul>
      
        <p class="question">Question 6: What are dangers of using attributes?</p>
        Shared by every servlet and every request in the application.

        <p class="question">Question 7: What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</p>
        HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that after a web server responds to a request, there is no "memory" of the
        request or who sent it.<br>
        A protocal which requires keeping of the internal state on the server is known as a stateful protocol, example: TCP
        connection-oriented session.

        <p class="question">Question 8: Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request.</li>
                <li>Session scope: destroyed when user closes browser.</li>
                <li>Application scope: destroyed when container stopped.</li>
                <li>Cookies saved on browser: temporary (deleted when the browser closes), permanent.</li>
                <li>Hidden field on a form.</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="question">Question 9: How long does a session last?</p>
        There are 3 ways to remove sessions:
            <ul>
                <li>session timeout in the DD.</li>
                <li>using method: session.setMaxInactiveInterval(time)</li>
                <li>using method: session.invalidate()</li>
            </ul>
 
        <p class="question">Question 10: What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</p>
        Cookie is small data which is stored on a client side. It is designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a
        particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. <br>
        There are two types of cookie:
            <ul>
                <li> temporary cookie</li>
                <li> browser removes when it closes</li>
                <li> this is default</li>
                <li> Permanent cookie: a cookie that has a max age set.</li>
            </ul>
    
        <p class="question">Question 11: What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</p>
        URL rewriting is used to provide shorter and more relevant-looking links to web pages.

        <p class="question">Question 12: Why does the request attribute report for the maintaining state demo?</p>
        Because it is destroyed when servlet finishes processing request
